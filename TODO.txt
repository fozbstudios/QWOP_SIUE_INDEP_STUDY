Stuff that Nick and I still need to do:

      Reward function needs to be finalized
      	     qio.currscore / (qio.tickcount + 1) = reward?


	Figure out how to start one round of the game


	Add a break out of the for loop starting at line76 for when the game "dies"
	    (figure out where to put the break)


	Figure out how to choose actions from our action space (25 actions from 0 - infinity (or some really high number))
	       once we pick our action, determine how to keep track of when to press and when to release from some local tickcount
	       	       (Potentially use a set of timers?) Maybe a queue of actions? potentially problems here though

		       Best approach right now is to keep an array of 4 keys and each time we choose a new action, incriment the appropriate count and then once
		       the timer reaches zero, release that key
